# mini-jekyll-w-boostrap
A very minimalistic jekyll-site featuring bootstrap stylesheets.

The tags in Git show the progress from very simple to more elaborate.

## Step 1

In [step 1](https://github.com/Harald-LB/mini-jekyll-w-boostrap/tree/step_1)
We have set up the following files:
- a basic `Gemfile`
- a basic `_config.yml` file
- and an elementary `index.html` file. 

After `bundle install` we run `jekyll build` and have the site build.
