# mini-jekyll-w-boostrap
A very minimalistic jekyll-site featuring bootstrap stylesheets.

The tags in Git show the progress from very simple to more elaborate.

## Step 1

In [step 1](https://github.com/Harald-LB/mini-jekyll-w-boostrap/tree/step_1)
we have set up the following files:
- a basic `Gemfile`
- a basic `_config.yml` file
- and an elementary `index.html` file. 

After `bundle install` we run `jekyll build` and have the site build.

## Step 2

In [step 2](https://github.com/Harald-LB/mini-jekyll-w-boostrap/tree/step_2)
we copy paste the example called "product" from the 
[Bootstrap site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/)

## Step 3

In [step 3](https://github.com/Harald-LB/mini-jekyll-w-boostrap/tree/step_3)
we "jekyllize" the `index.html` file.

## Step 4

In [step 4](https://github.com/Harald-LB/mini-jekyll-w-boostrap/tree/step_4)
we "sassify" the style sheet handling.
